I"µ<p>In 2015 research had revealed there was a disconnect between the Sheffield Hallam sports identity and how students supported their teams. It was felt that sport was perceived as elitist and non-inclusive to those who wanted to support the university sports teams but did not play sports themselves.</p>

<p>There also was a requirement to update the universities sports identity as sport was a core discipline within the university offer but the individual nature of the teams meant the organisation was not leveraging the sports identity as a whole.</p>

<p>As the head of content, I managed the core team that conducted user interviews, stakeholder workshops and surveys. This included engaging with over 100 students who represented over 30 sports societies.
The output of these sessions was the concept of â€˜Team Hallamâ€™ which primarily was the elite sports team brand but had a holistic effect of also covering the wider student and staff community. An elite logo and a supporter identity were created which had the synergies of the â€˜Hâ€™. This was taken up as Hallams 2nd brand as it offered multiple opportunities for students and staff to show their pride for their university in multiple ways.</p>

<p>In this piece of work I undertookÂ </p>

<ul>
  <li>the management and research of the users</li>
  <li>design of the identity</li>
  <li>creation of brand guidelines</li>
  <li>communication of the brand narrative</li>
</ul>

<p>Team Hallam has become more than a sports brand and has been used as a mechanism for staff and students to show their pride in being part of the university. It has been used in every context of university life and has even embedded its way into Sheffield Culture.</p>
