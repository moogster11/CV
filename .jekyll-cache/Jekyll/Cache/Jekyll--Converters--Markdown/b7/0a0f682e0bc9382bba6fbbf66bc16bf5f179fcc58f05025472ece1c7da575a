I" 	<p>I was tasked with improving the student onboarding service, this included</p>

<p><strong>Student enrolment</strong> - IT account setups, ordering of ID cards</p>

<p><strong>Student preparation</strong> - Course Induction Schedules, accommodation, healthcare tasks, funding, travel and study skills</p>

<p><strong>Student experience</strong> - Exploring university life. Booking events, campus orientation and support services</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Multiple services required redesign to deliver overall service</li>
  <li>Range of sub-audiences with varying user needs (international audiences)</li>
  <li>Inclusion of multiple legacy platforms and strategies</li>
  <li>As-is experience inconsistent and fragmented</li>
  <li>Multiple stakeholders to engage with</li>
  <li>Limited resource</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I did</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>created a multi-functional team (content design and UX) to deliver the design stage of the project</li>
  <li>mapped as-is experience and created report to highlight issues and opportunities</li>
  <li>held stakeholder workshops to map task priority (essential to low requirement)</li>
  <li>designed user journeys and service blueprints for the high value journeys and services</li>
  <li>created working prototypes with design system to test with users</li>
  <li>setup co-writing sessions with content designers and stakeholders to co-write the services</li>
  <li>briefed content designers and delivery team on the new services and the overall journeys</li>
  <li>introduced accessibility standards and reporting pre-launch of service</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outcome</strong>
New students rated the The University pre-arrival website pages highly (82.6%) followed closely by finding out about support services (81.2%). A considerable improvement on the year before. The experience was assessed and improvements were made for the next intake of students mid-year.</p>
