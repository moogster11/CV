<p><strong>Product manager</strong></p>

<p>Your product manager works with the delivery team to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>makes sure your service fits in with your organisation’s priorities</li>
  <li>define what the future goal of the service is (often called the ‘product vision’ in agile project management)</li>
  <li>make sure your service will meet user needs</li>
  <li>make sure your service is accessible to everyone, including disabled people</li>
  <li>prioritise user stories for each work sprint</li>
  <li>comment on technical, content and design solutions</li>
  <li>accept user stories when complete</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The service team you need in each phase</strong></p>

<p>Your team’s size and the roles you need will change as you build your service. You’ll need different skills during the different development phases.</p>

<div class="callout callout--info"><strong>All service teams must have the skills to:</strong>

- analyse user needs, including accessibility and assisted digital needs, and turn these into user stories

- create user stories and prioritise them

- manage and report to stakeholders and manage dependencies on other teams

- procure services from third parties, if needed
design, build, test and iterate software, and deploy and host the software

- test with real users

- measure the performance of the service

- find ways of accrediting and handling data

- support the live running of the service (monitoring, fixing things when they break, responding to users)
