### Working in short cycles 
Take small steps, try something new and see how it works. If it fails, you’ve invested very little. If it succeeds, keep doing it and improving on it.

### Hold regular retrospectives
At the end of each cycle, review what went well, what didn’t go well and vow to improve one or two key things.

### Put the customer at the center of everything 
if you’re struggling to get alignment as a team, focus on customer value. How do we know we’re shipping something users care about? How do we find out? How does that affect what we prioritize? These are good questions to ask on a regular basis.

### Go and see 
Regularly walk around, talk to your teams, ask them what’s working and where they’re struggling. Bring those learnings back to your management meetings and share with your colleagues. 

Patterns that yield good outcomes should be amplified. Those that are causing problems should be remedied.
At the end of the day your customers don’t care whether you’re agile, lean or practice design thinking. They care about great products and services that solve meaningful problems for them in effective ways. The more you can focus your teams on these things the better their process will be.
