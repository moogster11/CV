I was tasked with improving the student onboarding service, this included

**Student enrolment** - IT account setups, ordering of ID cards

**Student preparation** - Course Induction Schedules, accommodation, healthcare tasks, funding, travel and study skills

**Student experience** - Exploring university life. Booking events, campus orientation and support services

**Challenge**

- Multiple services required redesign to deliver overall service
- Range of sub-audiences with varying user needs (international audiences)
- Inclusion of multiple legacy platforms and strategies
- As-is experience inconsistent and fragmented
- Multiple stakeholders to engage with 
- Limited resource


**What I did**

- created a multi-functional team (content design and UX) to deliver the design stage of the project
- mapped as-is experience and created report to highlight issues and opportunities
- held stakeholder workshops to map task priority (essential to low requirement)
- designed user journeys and service blueprints for the high value journeys and services
- created working prototypes with design system to test with users
- setup co-writing sessions with content designers and stakeholders to co-write the services
- briefed content designers and delivery team on the new services and the overall journeys 
- introduced accessibility standards and reporting pre-launch of service

**Outcome**
New students rated the The University pre-arrival website pages highly (82.6%) followed closely by finding out about support services (81.2%). A considerable improvement on the year before. The experience was assessed and improvements were made for the next intake of students mid-year.
