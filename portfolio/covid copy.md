The Covid-19 situation fast-tracked a range of services that need to be urgently moved online. As the Covid situation became a permanent situation the covid information site (Keeping safe on campus) transitioned into becoming the central information area for the organisation and users. 
My role was to setup this service. I did this through
Startup

- Identified the opportunity to engage with marketing and communications teams regarding the importance of content design to deliver a service which was critical to university business
- Motivated my Digital Experience team to take a more hands-on content delivery role to ensure standards and a quality service was delivered. Especially as the service was so visible at a senior level

Discovery

- Held discovery sessions to understand business change requirements and potential user needs
- Conducted a content audit to identify overlapping areas of essential content (opening times, the impact of teaching etc)
- Created user journeys to understand opportunities to navigate users quickly to core information
- Managed content plan to support the consistent creation and management of information across the service

Delivery

- Used the SHU design system to rapidly build a web service area to deliver urgent messages
- Created content guidelines to ensure consistency of content approach across the organisation
- Communicated the benefits of content design to the wider Covid-19 team as the project grew 
- Integrated covid testing services when it came online
 
Reported analysis to senior silver and gold groups on relevant goals and events to demonstrate success. At all times communicating the positive aspects of a user-focused approach. This service supported the organisation as it worked through the impact of the pandemic. The clarity and ease of use of the pages were praised by senior managers and users alike.
