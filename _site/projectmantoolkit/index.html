<p>Discovery</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analysis</li>
  <li>User stories</li>
  <li>Product requirement docs</li>
</ul>

<p>Alpha</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prototyping</li>
  <li>Roadmap</li>
</ul>

<p>Beta</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delivery</li>
  <li>Roadmap</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Product manager</strong></p>

<p>Your product manager works with the delivery team to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>makes sure your service fits in with your organisation’s priorities</li>
  <li>define what the future goal of the service is (often called the ‘product vision’ in agile project management)</li>
  <li>make sure your service will meet user needs</li>
  <li>make sure your service is accessible to everyone, including disabled people</li>
  <li>prioritise user stories for each work sprint</li>
  <li>comment on technical, content and design solutions</li>
  <li>accept user stories when complete</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The service team you need in each phase</strong></p>

<p>Your team’s size and the roles you need will change as you build your service. You’ll need different skills during the different development phases.</p>

<p>All service teams must have the skills to:</p>

<p><br />- analyse user needs, including accessibility and assisted digital needs, and turn these into user stories
<br />- create user stories and prioritise them
<br />- manage and report to stakeholders and manage dependencies on other teams
<br />- procure services from third parties, if needed design, build, test and iterate software, and deploy and host the software&lt;
<br />- test with real users
<br />- measure the performance of the service
<br />- find ways of accrediting and handling data
<br />- support the live running of the service (monitoring, fixing things when they break, responding to users)</p>

<p><strong>Discovery</strong></p>

<p>During the discovery phase you’ll need a team with the skills to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>research and understand the user need for your proposed service
<br />- be aware of other services that exist and their development plans
<br />- start planning what your initial prototypes will explore</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alpha</strong></p>

<p>If your service progresses to the alpha phase you’ll need the skills to:&lt;/strong&gt;
<br />- explore ideas and build prototypes
<br />- solve the harder potential problems on the project
<br />- You must appoint a service owner during alpha.</p>

<p>By the end of the alpha, you should have a clear idea of what your beta will be and the team you’ll need to build it.</p>

<p><strong>Beta</strong></p>

<p>In the beta phase, the main priority is creating a simple, clear, fast service while your team works toward live operation. The team needs to have the skills to make frequent iterations based on regular user testing.</p>

<p>At this phase, you may need to increase the size of the team.</p>

<p>You may need more input from performance analysts, web operations and developers, and an increase in the number of designers and content designers.&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Live</strong></p>

<p>When your service moves from beta to the live phase, you’ll usually have met most of your user needs and have less work left to do. However, you must still plan to have a sustainable, multidisciplinary team that can:</p>

<p><br />- finish building any additional features you’ve planned for your service
<br />- manage and maintain your service
<br />- iterate and improve your service frequently based on changes in your users’ needs or other circumstances (for example, changes to technology or other government policy or programmes)
<br />- This means you’ll need to plan how and when you change the size of your team and the roles in it. To work out when and how to do this, you and your team should review your service’s roadmap, release plans and product backlog.
&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>Changes can also affect morale. Talk to your team to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>let them know what’s happening</li>
  <li>discover how they feel about any changes</li>
  <li>find out how they want to deal with the changes</li>
</ul>
