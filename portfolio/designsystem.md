In my current role, I led and implemented an organisational design system. This was delivered through
- Influencing senior stakeholders on how a systematic approach would support consistency and cost-saving through an understood design approach.

- Working directly with technology partners to create efficiency through refactoring and removal of inaccessible code and legacy platforms.

- Working with my team to audit current website design and components to understand gaps and inconsistencies

- Demonstrating the faster to market approach through reusing of successful patterns, components and guidelines.

- Communicating the benefits to stakeholders including design alignment across platforms, cost-saving through reusable design, faster prototyping

- Working with non-designers to develop a community of practice to widen design conversations across the organisation.

- Presenting to stakeholders a measurement framework. Demonstrating measurable improvement in design across the web estate.Â 

The output has been a measurable improvement in design creation and accessibility standards across the web estate. As well as an improvement in the service conversations being had across the organisations
