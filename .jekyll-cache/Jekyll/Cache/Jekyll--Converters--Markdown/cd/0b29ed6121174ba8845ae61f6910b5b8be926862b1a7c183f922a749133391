<p>The university website homepage has the largest source of traffic for potential students searching for courses. This also include all other main audiences who navigate the universities range of products and offers. The current homepage has not been updated in over five years and as such was not in a position to take on board new strategic opportunities. The project was to redesign the homepage looking for opportunities to implement new strategies and new ways of working as well as improve the design.</p>

Delivery</p>
  </li>
  <li>This project is currently with the development team with a delivery date in March 2021. The homepage also includes the redesign of global navigation components so there will be a wider rollout of these components post-launch. This will include communication of changes to wider users of the CMS.</li>
</ul>

<p>The new homepage has been tested to improve all aspects of the homepage experience including navigation. This includes bringing forward high-value user content (event booking, course searches) without the need for users to click through to find it. It also brings forward highly tactical content (news, editorial) which supports the positioning of the university and its brand. The new design also offers the ability to create personalisation opportunities for return users and support profile building on the CMS.##</p>
