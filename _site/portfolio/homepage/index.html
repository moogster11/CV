<p>The university website homepage has the largest source of traffic for potential students searching for courses. This also include all other main audiences who navigate the universities range of products and offers. The current homepage has not been updated in over five years and as such was not in a position to take on board new strategic opportunities. The project was to redesign the homepage looking for opportunities to implement new strategies and new ways of working as well as improve the design.</p>

<p>Startup</p>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p>Presented the vision to multiple high-level stakeholders to gain buy-in including opportunities potential for changes in strategy 
    - Created a vision document that outlined the approach to support gaining buy-in from stakeholders and wider delivery team</p>
</div>

<h1 id="discovery">Discovery</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Worked with analysts and optimisation specialists to create data studio reports which visualised user behaviour over the last two years.</li>
  <li>Presented user videos and heatmaps of user activity to senior stakeholders to demonstrate user behaviour</li>
  <li>Established user stories and personas to support the narrative of what all users were doing on the homepage</li>
  <li>Created a competitor and gap analysis </li>
  <li>
    <p>Worked with designers to create the visual direction of the homepage and how this could align with global design updates that were being implemented 
Definition</p>
  </li>
  <li>Led on user journey sessions with wider teams to map how users were using the homepage</li>
  <li>Established design principles for the homepage that would be taken forward</li>
  <li>Held content mapping sessions to understand the types of content that users were engaging with</li>
  <li>Defined the content strategy for the homepage that would support the governance approach to managing homepage as well as any business process change that was necessary</li>
  <li>
    <p>Established need for governance group to support content planning of homepage
Design</p>
  </li>
  <li>Worked with designers and developers to create high-fidelity HTML prototypes. This was to present to stakeholders and usability test with users</li>
  <li>Reported on useability testing to stakeholders and refined designs</li>
  <li>Documented new components into the design system </li>
  <li>Worked with the team to create users stories acceptance criteria to support handover to the development team</li>
  <li>Captured technical specifications to support integration with CMS</li>
  <li>
    <p>Established an analytics plan to support optimisation and improvement. 
Delivery</p>
  </li>
  <li>This project is currently with the development team with a delivery date in March 2021. The homepage also includes the redesign of global navigation components so there will be a wider rollout of these components post-launch. This will include communication of changes to wider users of the CMS.</li>
</ul>

<p>The new homepage has been tested to improve all aspects of the homepage experience including navigation. This includes bringing forward high-value user content (event booking, course searches) without the need for users to click through to find it. It also brings forward highly tactical content (news, editorial) which supports the positioning of the university and its brand. The new design also offers the ability to create personalisation opportunities for return users and support profile building on the CMS.##</p>
