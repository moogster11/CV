<p><strong>Product manager</strong></p>

<p>Your product manager works with the delivery team to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>makes sure your service fits in with your organisationâ€™s priorities</li>
  <li>define what the future goal of the service is (often called the â€˜product visionâ€™ in agile project management)</li>
  <li>make sure your service will meet user needs</li>
  <li>make sure your service is accessible to everyone, including disabled people</li>
  <li>prioritise user stories for each work sprint</li>
  <li>comment on technical, content and design solutions</li>
  <li>accept user stories when complete</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The service team you need in each phase</strong></p>

<p>Your teamâ€™s size and the roles you need will change as you build your service. Youâ€™ll need different skills during the different development phases.</p>

<div class="callout callout--info"><strong>All service teams must have the skills to:</strong>

<br />- analyse user needs, including accessibility and assisted digital needs, and turn these into user stories&lt;/br&gt;

<br />- create user stories and prioritise them&lt;/br&gt;

<br />- manage and report to stakeholders and manage dependencies on other teams&lt;/br&gt;

<br />- procure services from third parties, if needed
design, build, test and iterate software, and deploy and host the software&lt;/br&gt;

<br />- test with real users&lt;/br&gt;

<br />- measure the performance of the service&lt;/br&gt;

<br />- find ways of accrediting and handling data&lt;/br&gt;

<br />- support the live running of the service (monitoring, fixing things when they break, responding to users)&lt;/br&gt;
