**Product manager**

Your product manager works with the delivery team to:

- makes sure your service fits in with your organisation’s priorities
- define what the future goal of the service is (often called the ‘product vision’ in agile project management)
- make sure your service will meet user needs
- make sure your service is accessible to everyone, including disabled people
- prioritise user stories for each work sprint
- comment on technical, content and design solutions
- accept user stories when complete

**The service team you need in each phase**

Your team’s size and the roles you need will change as you build your service. You’ll need different skills during the different development phases.

<div class="callout callout--info"><strong>All service teams must have the skills to:</strong>

<br>- analyse user needs, including accessibility and assisted digital needs, and turn these into user stories

<br>- create user stories and prioritise them<

<br>- manage and report to stakeholders and manage dependencies on other teams

<br>- procure services from third parties, if needed
design, build, test and iterate software, and deploy and host the software<

<br>- test with real users

<br>- measure the performance of the service

<br>- find ways of accrediting and handling data

<br>- support the live running of the service (monitoring, fixing things when they break, responding to users)</br>
